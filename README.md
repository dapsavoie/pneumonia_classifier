This project requires creating an image classifier that identifies pneumonia in patients. 

The best performing model contains data that was augmented in the normal category and added to a file called normal_aug.

This augmented was data was then tested on the best performing model. It improved recall score by 6% to 86% with 97% accuracy.

This indicates that class balancing improved the output. However, further work is needed to prevent false negatives.
